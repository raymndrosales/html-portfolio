<h1>My Favorite Movies of All Time Ranked</h1>
<h2>My Top 5 All Time Favorite Movies</h2>
<hr />

<h3>The Lion King</h3>
<p>When I was a kid, my mother bought me a Lion King movie tape because I was literally mimicking how the lion roars and turns out I really like the movie especially how the story have gone.</p>

<h3>The Notebook</h3>
<p>This movie is 11 out of 10 and honestly, I never thought that it is going to end up being one of my favorite movie of all time. My ex-girlfriend suggest that we watch this movie together and now it is one of the reasons why I would never forget her.</p>

<h3>The Green Mile</h3>
<p>Even though a fantasy movie, it made me realize how cruel the world is. Sometimes, we abandon ourselves for the sake of following the rules. This movie is a story of a man who was falsely accused of a crime he never commited. Despite all his kindness and proofs of being an innocent man, rules still crushed him.</p>

<h3>Forrest Gump</h3>
<p>I like how this movie makes me think that even an idiot man can be rich and do everything he wants just by starting and never stopping. Great movie 11 out of 10.</p>

<h3>American Pie</h3>
<p>Watched it when I was a teenager and I related to the movie so much that I laugh hard whenever.</p>
